Implementation of a Petri Net

## Authors

Arthur LOIZEAU

Victor DANTAS

## Code version

This project run with Eclipse 4.33.0 and a JRE build 17.0.13

## Starting 

You can create your own PetriNet in the main method in **src.classesPetriNet.PetriNet** then execute it.

## Tests

Tests are integrated in 2 ways :

1- Each method contains tests for both the inputs and outputs

2- Each class is tested via JUnit tests

In order to run the tests, you can execute the different classes in the **org.pneditor.petrinet.tests.imta** package as JUnit Test

## Modifications

Minor changes occurred between design and implementation :

  -changing the names of variables/methods/classes in order to respect the rules of good usage
  
  -added minimal constants to comply with the rules of good use
  
  -added useful getters for adaptation
